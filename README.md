# my-first-datascience-project-BNA
this is my first data science project. the tittle of the project is "Bank note authentication" 
this data set is taken from kaggle.
the small description about the project "Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images."
first i created the model using random forest classifier algorithm.
then i checked the model accuracy.
then i try to deploy the model using flask and flasgger swagger
i have also use the streamlit lib for deployment model with help of flask and streamlit web application. you can check out the files added to the repository
